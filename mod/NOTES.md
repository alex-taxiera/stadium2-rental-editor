# Rental editor — working notes

Reverse-engineering notes for the rental editor mod. Addresses are for the US ROM
(sha1 `d8343e69a7dc63b869cf6361d87cde64444281d3`). Each fact is tagged:
**[C]** confirmed in source, **[I]** inferred and still to be verified at runtime.

Base: `michiiik/pokestadiumgs` pinned at `e06da865` (branch `rental-editor`).
Plan: `C:\Users\Alex\.claude\plans\i-want-to-build-delightful-lecun.md`.

## Building

The build runs in WSL (Ubuntu). From the repo root inside WSL:

    python3 tools/mod/check_rom.py <path-to-rom>   # verify + install baserom
    tools/mod/wsl_build.sh init                    # first time
    tools/mod/wsl_build.sh                         # afterwards

`wsl_build.sh` mirrors the sources to `~/stadium2-build` (native ext4) because building
on the Windows drive is slow, then copies the ROM, map and ELF back into `build/`.

## In-memory Pokémon record (0x58 bytes)

Recovered from the GB <-> internal converters in `src/615D0.c`
(`func_80061124` Gen 2 party struct -> internal, `func_800614EC` the reverse,
`func_80060FF8` / `func_800613F8` the Gen 1 pair). Size confirmed by
`func_82B062F8` (`_bzero(arg0, 0x58)`). **[C]** for offsets, **[I]** for the names.

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0x00 | u8 | species |
| 0x01 | u8 | held item |
| 0x02 | u8[4] | moves |
| 0x06 | u16 | OT ID |
| 0x08 | u32 | experience |
| 0x0C | u16 x5 | stat exp: HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, Special |
| 0x16 | u16 | DVs (Atk/Def nibbles, Spd/Spc nibbles) |
| 0x18 | u8[4] | PP |
| 0x1C | u8 | happiness |
| 0x1D | u8 | level |
| 0x1E | u8 | flags (bit 0 tested in `func_800616BC`: forces current HP to 0) |
| 0x20 | u8 | pokerus |
| 0x21 | u8[2] | caught data |
| 0x24 | u8 | status |
| 0x26 | u16 | current HP |
| 0x28 | u16 x6 | max HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def |
| 0x34 | char[12] | name A — receives text 0x1B/0x30 for empty rental slots, so probably OT name |
| 0x40 | char[12] | name B — probably nickname |
| 0x4C | u8[11] | trailing bytes copied as a block (`func_80061248`) |

Stat calculation: `func_8006183C(stat, species, statExp, level, dvs)` (still asm).
`StatExpSqrt` is at `0x8006175C`.

## Rental data in ROM

Source: `pret/pokestadium` `oldnotes/utils/extractrostertbltbl.c` and `json2rostertbl.c`.

- Table of tables at ROM `0x1708000`; table count/pointers start at `+0xC`. **[I]**
- Each table: `u8 count`, 3 zero bytes, then records.
- Rental tables: Little Cup (86 entries, L5), Poké Cup (246, L50), Prime Cup (246 and 248, L100).

Rental record, 24 bytes, big-endian:

| Offset | Field |
|---|---|
| 0x00 | level |
| 0x01 | species |
| 0x02 | item (always 0 for rentals) |
| 0x03 | unknown |
| 0x04 | moves[4] |
| 0x08 | unknown |
| 0x09 | happiness |
| 0x0A | stat exp x5 (u16) |
| 0x14 | DVs (u16) |
| 0x16 | unknown x2 |

Rental records carry no nickname or OT; those are filled in when the record is expanded.

## Fragments (overlays)

Same system as Stadium 1 (`pret/pokestadium` `src/memmap.c`, `include/macros.h`).

- Header, 0x20 bytes: two entry instructions, `"FRAGMENT"`, `headerSize`, `relocOffset`,
  `sizeInRom`, `sizeInRam`.
- Fragment ID = `((vram & 0x0FF00000) >> 20) - 0x10`, so ID `n` lives at `0x81000000 + n * 0x100000`.
- `Fragment_Load(id, romStart, romEnd)` at `0x800047F8`; `Fragment_LoadAndCall` at `0x80064CE8`.
  The caller supplies the ROM range, so a new fragment needs no table entry. **[C]**
- Relocation table at `relocOffset`: `u32 count`, then `(type << 24) | offset` words.
  Types: `R_MIPS_32` (2), `R_MIPS_26` (4), `R_MIPS_HI16` (5), `R_MIPS_LO16` (6).
  Only addresses in fragment space are relocated; main-segment addresses are left alone.
- Both GS repos include the stock relocation tables as raw data, so stock fragments cannot
  change size until `tools/mod/fragment_relocs.py` regenerates them.
- IDs in use (from `MatandoYT/pokestadiumgs`): 0x00, 0x01, 0x03, 0x04, 0x06–0x0C, 0x10–0x25, 0x2F,
  0x31–0x34, 0x50–0x5C, 0x6C–0x7D, 0x9B, 0x9C, 0x9E, 0x9F, 0xE0–0xEE. `0x40` is free. **[I]**

## ROM layout

- Main segment `0x1000–0xA8A80`, vram `0x80000400`.
- Fragments 1–88 at `0xA8A80–0x437610`; the first megabyte is covered by the header CRC.
- `0x437610–0x4000000` is one asset blob that must not move.
- `0x16061C0–0x1638000` is `0xFF` padding (~204 KB): home for the mod fragment. **[I]**
  `check_rom.py` verifies it on the real ROM.

## Fragment 24 (vram 0x82B00000) — candidate team-building screen

`src/fragments/24/fragment24_150C10.c`. Evidence so far:

- `func_82B062F8(mon, n)` zeroes a 0x58-byte Pokémon record, sets the level from the
  4-entry table `D_82B0865C[n]`, and copies text 0x1B/0x30 into name A. Looks like
  "initialise an empty rental slot for rule set n". **[C]** for behaviour.
- Screen state lives at `D_82B12450`; panels use 640x480 coordinates and slide in/out
  (`func_82B01BB8`, `func_82B02ABC`).
- Still asm and probably the interesting part: `func_82B06360`, `func_82B0671C`,
  `func_82B06C98`, `func_82B070B8`, `func_82B050E8`, `func_82B04718`.

Other callers of the registered-team helpers (`Deck_*`, struct converters):
fragments 6, 14, 64, 77, 82 and `src/517E0.c`, `src/68F90.c`.

## Drawing helpers (main segment, used by fragment 24)

Signatures inferred from call sites; names are ours. **[I]**

| Address | Use |
|---|---|
| `func_800498C4()` | begin text drawing |
| `func_800496A4(font, 0)` | select font |
| `func_8004972C(r, g, b, a)` | text colour |
| `func_800495F8(x, y, flag, str)` | draw string |
| `func_800499EC()` | end text drawing |
| `func_8004C874(bank, index)` | look up a string |
| `func_8004C990(bank, index)` | look up an image/asset |
| `func_8004D19C(x, y, image, 0, 0)` | draw image |
| `func_8004B35C(x, y, w, h, tex)` | draw textured rect |

Already named in the fork: `Ui_DrawBorderedPanel`, `Ui_DrawGradientPanel`,
`Input_GetRepeatedDPad`, `Cont_StartReadInputs`, `WidgetTree_OpenMessagePanel`.

## Move legality table

`tools/mod/gen_legal_moves.py` writes `mod/data/legal_moves.inc.c`:
`sLegalMoves[252][32]`, row = national dex number, bit = move id (8 KB).

- Rule: legal if the species or an earlier stage learns it in Gen 1–2 by level-up, TM/HM,
  tutor or egg. Event-only moves are out (`--include-events` flips that).
- Sources: Pokémon Showdown's Gen 2 learnsets, plus the Gold and Crystal level-up tables
  from the pret disassemblies. The two agree on level-up moves for all 251 species except
  Porygon's Conversion 2 and Porygon2's Tackle, which Showdown lacks; `--report` lists this.
- Egg moves come from Showdown only: Gold's table still lists moves with no possible
  father (Charm, Lovely Kiss, Staryu's set), which Showdown correctly leaves out.
- Check against the game: all 3,248 moves on the four stock rental tables pass, except
  Prime Cup Psyduck's Amnesia, an event move the developers gave their own rental.

Judgment calls, easy to revisit:

- In-game gift moves count as events and are excluded (Crystal's ExtremeSpeed Dratini,
  Odd Egg Dizzy Punch), because Showdown records them as event data.
- Pikachu's Surf is allowed: Showdown classes the Stadium 1 reward as a tutor move.
- Smeargle gets every move except Struggle, Explosion and Selfdestruct.
- Not enforced: move combinations that cannot coexist, and level requirements
  (the stock rentals ignore those too).

Tests: `python3 -m unittest discover -s mod/tests` (22 tests).

## Open questions (milestone M1)

1. Which function expands a 24-byte rental record into the 0x58-byte record?
2. Where is the per-Pokémon menu built, and is it shared by Free Battle and registration?
3. Does a registered team store the full record or a rental index?
4. Does battle setup re-read the rental table?
5. Free main-pool RAM while the picker is open (`main_pool_get_available`).
6. Where are cup level rules stored? (`D_82B0865C` is a lead.)
7. Is fragment ID 0x40 really free, and how large is the fragment map?
